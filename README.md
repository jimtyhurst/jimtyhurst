I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a PhD in Linguistics, doing data engineering, feature engineering, statistical analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing. Previously, I was a software engineer developing enterprise software, so I know how to get from prototypes to production. That knowledge has transferred well to ML work.
